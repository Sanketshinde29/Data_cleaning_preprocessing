# Data_cleaning_preprocessing
# In this dataset I am using Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing involve preparing raw data for analysis by correcting or removing inaccurate, incomplete, or duplicate records. 
# Steps that performed in project:
1.Removing Duplicates
2.Fill Missing Values
3.Format the Data :
   # Check if date columns (like date_added) are in proper Date format.
   # Ensure all numeric columns (if any) are recognized as Number type.
   # Trim any extra spaces using TRIM() function for text columns if needed.
4.I converted the column headers to uppercase to maintain consistency and improve readability.
